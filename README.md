Overview
---
This [.NET](http://www.microsoft.com/NET) library provides convenient, threadsafe access to [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/) devices. It does this by binding to the [Win32 API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms712733(VS.85).aspx) with [P/Invoke](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288468(VS.71).aspx) and then wrapping that in an object-oriented API which feels right at home in C# / .NET.

For a taste of what the API offers, check out the [example snippets](https://github.com/jstnryan/midi-dot-net/wiki/Simple-Examples).

Features
---
- **MIDI**

  * Easy access to MIDI input and output devices.
  * Register input handlers using C# events / delegates.
  * Full support for sending and receiving Note On, Note Off, Control Change, Program Change, Pitch Bend, and raw System Exclusive (SysEx) messages.
  * Convenient enums for General MIDI Channels, Pitches, Instruments, Controls, and Percussions.

- **Scheduling**

  * A powerful scheduler that lets you schedule MIDI messages, pause, unpause, and adjust beats-per-minute **while it runs**.
  * Support for callback messages, so you can schedule call-outs to your own code at specific instants. Callback messages are scheduled just like MIDI messages, so they are subject to pause, unpause, and beats-per-minute as well.
  * Callback messages can schedule additional messages when triggered (**self-propagating messages**), which allows for a flexible continuation-passing style of control.
  * Built-in NoteOnOffMessage schedules the Off message when the On message triggers.

- **Music Theory**

  * Octave-independent Note class which differentiates among enharmonic variants (eg, D♯; and E♭). Notes can be resolved to specific pitches as needed.
  * Scale class built from tonic note and ascent pattern. Includes built-in patterns (Major, Melodic Minor Ascending, Chromatic, etc).
  * Chord class built from tonic note, ascent pattern, and inversion. Includes built-in chord patterns (Major, Seventh, Diminished, etc).

- **Documentation**

  * Interactive demo programs, both console and GUI.
  * Comprehensive API documentation.
  * Unit tests.

Not-Yet-Features
---
* No MIDI file I/O.

Requirements
---
* .NET Framework 3.5.
* Visual Studio C# 2008 (Express or Professional) or later.
* winmm.dll, the Win32 multimedia API which is standard on all modern Windows installs.
